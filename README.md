How 2 keygen :
- concatenate the name string with the specific hardcore string -- > http://accdbpassword.bistonesoft.com
- get the length of the name (or mail) and hardcored string for the MD5 hash variable
- compute the MD5 hashing on both of these strings
- convert the hexadecimal chars into unicode chars with Hex2ch (or HexToChar) applet.
- This one is optional - in case if the app requires also the @ symbol, in this case i've used an @ symbol detector applet to detect the symbol - thanks 2 Tomahawk[EDGE] for this asm applet :)
- and the serial length should be 32 chars maximum.
